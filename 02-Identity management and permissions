- How it works
    - IAM principals must be authenticated to send requests
    - A principal is a person or applicatoin that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resaource
    - AWS determines whether to autorize the requests
        - Identity-Based policy is for users
        - Resource-Based policy is for resources like s3
- Users
    - Root users 
        - created when you create the account
        - has full permissions
        - best practice to not use
    - create up to 5000 individual accounts
    - Have no permissions by default
